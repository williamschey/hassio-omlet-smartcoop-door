# hassio-omlet-smartcoop-door
Home Assistant integration to monitor and control Omlet Smart Coop Door

Add repo to HACS by adding custom repository https://github.com/williamschey/hassio-omlet-smartcoop-door

You will need to create an API Key from https://smart.omlet.com/developers/

Still need to:
[ ] Add cofig items
[ ] Add actions for cofig and polling etc.
[ ] Anything with groups

Enjoy!
